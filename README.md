# CrIMR: Integrating Machine Learning with CRY Mutation Sequencing and Repressor Gene Expression Analysis for Personalized DSPD and ASPD Diagnosis and Treatment

Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) and Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder (ASPD) are 2 prominent disorders based upon the circadian rhythm, with DSPS impacting at least 15% of adolescents and adults and ASPD impacting at least 1% of the population. Within circadian rhythm, the Cryptochrome circadian regulator (CRY) 1 acts as a repressors to the circadian clock feedback loop. DSPS and ASPD occur due to mutations in the CRY genes, affecting sleep-wake cycles and worsening into disorders like insomnia. Our research project aims to use CRY1 genetic sequences from the BLAST NCBI GenBank and ClinVar databases to train an Isolation Forest - based machine learning algorithm to detect these mutations. An internal algorithm using NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus will calculate the CLOCK-BMAL1 Activity, which determines the level of repression present, and using the Hill Function, the algorithm will be able to calculate how much excess PER or CRY2 expression or external protein levels is needed to regulate the repression.
